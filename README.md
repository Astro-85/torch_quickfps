# PyTorch FPSample

Efficient **farthest point sampling (FPS)** for PyTorch, adapted from [fpsample](https://github.com/leonardodalinky/fpsample).

This project provides bucket-based FPS on both CPU and GPU. The GPU path is optimized for high-dimensional sampling (e.g., feature embeddings).

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/Astro-85/pytorch_fpsample

# Build locally
pip install .
````

---

## Usage

```python
import torch
import torch_fpsample

x = torch.rand(64, 2048, 256)

# Random sample
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024)

# Random sample with specific tree height
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, h=3)

# Random sample with start point index (int)
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, start_idx=0)

# For high-dimensional embeddings on CUDA, set low_d for faster bucketing
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, h=8, low_d=8)

# Indices-only
indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, return_points=False)
# (equivalently)
indices = torch_fpsample.sample_idx(x, 1024)

# Masked sampling: only sample from valid points (mask shape [B, N])
mask = torch.ones(x.shape[:-1], dtype=torch.bool)
mask[:, 1000:] = False  # e.g. padding
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 512, mask=mask)

print(sampled_points.size(), indices.size())
# torch.Size([64, 1024, 3]) torch.Size([64, 1024])
```

## CUDA support

This package builds a CUDA extension when a CUDA toolchain is available (`nvcc` / `CUDA_HOME`).

* Force CUDA build: `WITH_CUDA=1 pip install .`
* Force CPU-only build: `WITH_CUDA=0 pip install .`

## Performance comparison

Comparison includes CPU, a vanilla GPU FPS baseline, and our bucketed GPU implementation.

* **N**: number of input points
* **D**: point dimension
* **K**: number of sampled points
* **CPU vs GPU (bucketed)**: `CPU_ms / GPU_bucketed_ms`
* **GPU baseline vs bucketed**: `GPU_baseline_ms / GPU_bucketed_ms`
